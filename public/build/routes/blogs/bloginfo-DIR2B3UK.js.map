When Larry Liu first immigrated to the U.S., he realised there wasn\u2019t an easy way for the Asian community to buy the goods needed to make some of their favorite dishes. Wanting to provide a place to celebrate and bring widespread access to Asian and Hispanic food, he turned to the App Store to launch grocery delivery app Weee! People would no longer have to be limited to the small \u201Cethnic\u201D aisle at mainstream grocery stores. As big advocates for human connection, Dawoon Kang and her twin sister Arum teamed up to found Coffee Meets Bagel, a dating app with an intentionally \u201Cslower\u201D approach. Their algorithm focuses not on getting users the most likes, but on guiding them toward meaningful conversations. As one of the most popular dating apps, Coffee Meets Bagel has facilitated over 150 million matches to date.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p className=\"text-md font-normal text-primary mt-10\">\r\n                        Annie Vang, a participant of Apple Entrepreneur Camp in 2021, created HmongPhrases to help preserve the Hmong dialect for future generations. Though the Hmong population has been in the U.S. for over 40 years, it is widely considered one of the most marginalised Asian groups. Her app allows users to search for a phrase in Hmong, hear what it sounds like, and then practice saying it out loud. As a true labor of love, not only does Annie do the coding for the app herself \u2014 she even records the phrases in her own voice. Liu, Kang, and Vang discuss how they used technology to transform their ideas into powerful platforms, how their apps uplift their communities, and how they influence positive change.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"bg-[#EFEFEF] w-full my-10 rounded-xl md:p-0 p-6\">\r\n                    <div className=\"w-full md:w-3/5 lg:w-4/6 mx-auto mb-10  py-8\">\r\n                        <h3 className=\"text-primary text-3xl font-bold\">Top picks</h3>\r\n                        <div className=\"h-[1px] bg-gray-600 w-full my-2\"></div>\r\n                        <BigBlogCard title=\"Swupnil Sahai and his co\u2011founder serve an ace with AI\u2011powered SwingVision\" time=\"May 26, 2022\" imageUrl=\"./images/blogs/blog4.png\" ></BigBlogCard>\r\n                        <BigBlogCard title=\"App Store stopped nearly $1.5 billion in fraudulent transactions in 2021\" time=\"May 26, 2022\" imageUrl=\"./images/blogs/blog5.png\" ></BigBlogCard>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"w-full md:w-3/5 lg:w-4/6 mx-auto mb-10  py-8\">\r\n                    <h3 className=\"text-primary text-3xl font-bold\">Related article</h3>\r\n                    <div className=\"h-[1px] bg-gray-600 w-full my-2\"></div>\r\n                    <div className=\"grid xl:grid-cols-3 grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 justify-center\">\r\n\r\n                        <BlogsCard title=\"Swupnil Sahai and his co\u2011founder serve an ace with AI\u2011powered SwingVision\" time=\"June 1, 2022\" imageUrl=\"./images/blogs/blog4.png\"></BlogsCard>\r\n                        <BlogsCard title=\"New report highlights global success of small businesses and entrepreneurs on the App Store\" time=\"June 1, 2022\" imageUrl=\"./images/blogs/blog3.png\"></BlogsCard>\r\n                        <BlogsCard title=\"Three AAPI founders building apps on the App Store that cultivate community\" time=\"June 1, 2022\" imageUrl=\"./images/blogs/blog10.png\"></BlogsCard>\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n        </>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\nexport default BlogsInfo;", "import { Footer } from \"~/components/home/footer/footer\";\r\nimport { IntroNavBar } from \"~/components/home/navbar/intronavbar\";\r\nimport BlogsInfo from \"~/components/blogpage/bloginfo\";\r\nconst blogs = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <>\r\n            <IntroNavBar></IntroNavBar>\r\n            <BlogsInfo></BlogsInfo>\r\n            <Footer></Footer>\r\n        </>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\nexport default blogs;"],
